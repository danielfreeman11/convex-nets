\item Context of the problem
\item Related work: Spin glass, recent results from Shamir. Gradient Descent converges to minimizers (Jordan Recht et al). 
\item Topology of the level sets. Main result on connectedness of level sets.
\item Geometry of the level sets. Algorithm to estimate the geodesics along level sets. Measure of curvature of these sets. 
\end{itemize}
